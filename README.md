Background:
Gestational exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) has been associated with elevated risk for neurodevelopmental disorders. Placental epigenetics may serve as a potential mechanism of risk or marker of altered placental function. Prior studies have associated differential placental DNA methylation with maternal PCB exposure or with increased risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, sequencing-based placental methylomes have not previously been tested for simultaneous associations with maternal PCB levels and child neurodevelopmental outcomes.

Objectives:
We aimed to identify placental DNA methylation patterns associated with maternal PCB levels and child neurodevelopmental outcomes in the high-risk ASD MARBLES cohort.

Methods:
We measured 209 PCB congeners in 104 maternal serum samples collected at delivery. We identified networks of DNA methylation from 147 placenta samples using the Comethyl R package, which performs weighted gene correlation network analysis for whole genome bisulfite sequencing data. We tested placental DNA methylation modules for association with maternal serum PCB levels, child neurodevelopment, and other participant traits.

Results:
PCBs 153 + 168, 170, 180 + 193, and 187 were detected in over 50% of maternal serum samples and were highly correlated with one another. Consistent with previous findings, maternal age was the strongest predictor of serum PCB levels, alongside year of sample collection, pre-pregnancy BMI, and polyunsaturated fatty acid levels. Twenty seven modules of placental DNA methylation were identified, including five which significantly correlated with one or more PCBs, and four which correlated with child neurodevelopment. Two modules associated with maternal PCB levels as well as child neurodevelopment, and mapped to CSMD1 and AUTS2, genes previously implicated in ASD and identified as differentially methylated regions in mouse brain and placenta following gestational PCB exposure.

Conclusions:
Placental DNA co-methylation modules were associated with maternal PCBs and child neurodevelopment. Methylation of CSMD1 and AUTS2 could be markers of altered placental function and/or ASD risk following maternal PCB exposure.
